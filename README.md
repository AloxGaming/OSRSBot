# OSRSBot
To run this bot be sure to have installed RuneLite as it will search for images found in this program.

Currently you'll need to be at the karamja f2p port.
The batch file asks for the accounts password since sometimes it gets logged out and so if you've entered the password, it'll automatically re-login for you. All code is open source so feel free to rummage through.

When ready, run the batch file.
